# Phimen_4 Solutions

This repository contains C++ solutions to various competitive programming problems. Each file corresponds to a specific problem statement.

## Files and Problem Descriptions

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `rotate.cpp` | **Rotate**: Given a 3-digit integer `abc`, finds the sum `abc + bca + cab`. |
| `nearly_lucky_number.cpp` | **Nearly Lucky Number**: Determines if a number is "nearly lucky" by checking if the count of its lucky digits (4 and 7) is itself a lucky number. |
| `multi_test_cases.cpp` | **Odd Numbers**: Counts how many numbers are odd in a given sequence for multiple test cases. |
| `worth_of_a_video.cpp` | **Worth of a Video**: Calculates the total "worth" of a video in words, given that 1 second = 24 frames and 1 frame = 1000 words. |
| `attack.cpp` | **Enemy Attack**: Calculates the minimum number of attacks required to reduce an enemy's stamina to 0 or less. |
| `subscribers.cpp` | **Approximation**: Prints an approximation of a number $N$ by truncating digits based on the magnitude of $N$. |
| `2UP3DOWN.cpp` | **Stairs or Elevator**: Determines whether to use stairs or an elevator based on movement constraints (up to 2 floors up, up to 3 floors down). |
| `greedy_takahashi.cpp` | **Cookie Eating**: Simulates a process where Takahashi and Aoki eat cookies for $K$ turns, with Takahashi prioritizing his own cookies. |
| `dislike_of_threes.cpp` | **Dislike of Threes**: Finds the $k$-th positive integer that is not divisible by 3 and does not end with the digit 3. |
| `long_loong.cpp` | **Dragon String**: Generates a string like "Looong" where the number of 'o's matches the input level $N$. |

## How to Compile and Run

You can compile any of the solutions using a C++ compiler like `g++`. For example:

```bash
g++ -o rotate rotate.cpp
./rotate
```

Then provide the input as specified in the problem statement.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
